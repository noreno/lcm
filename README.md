The project contains files for solving a life-cycle model using dynamic programming to find optimal consumption and portfolio choice.

Improvements have been made with respect to the help functions.

Newer versions include several major improvements with respect to the main function, especially speeding up interpolation methods (splines).

For details about the model, see the original paper:
